<img alt="Developer Kit" src="./docs/media/devkit-arch.png" width="75%" height="auto">

The BGAN IoT Developer Kit comes with everything you need to start working with
Inmarsat's IP IoT connectivity service ***BGAN(M2M)***:
    
* A satellite modem, self-contained with antenna and GNSS in a weatherproof
enclosure
* Cables to connect to AC or 12VC DC power, including an international power
adapter, cable extenders and a magnetic roof-mount for the satellite modem
if applicable
* A single-board computer (SBC) with interface to the satellite modem, which
provides:
    * WiFi access point for your laptop, tablet or smartphone to acccess a
    the FieldEdge Graphical User Interface (GUI)
    * A Graphical User Interface to the satellite modem and SBC
    * BGAN simulation and packet capture/analysis tools
    * Router and firewall tools for preventing unexpected data use
    * A simple demo "Edge" application that generates location and modem
    telemetry data and allows sending/receiving text messages

## Before you begin...

>:information_source: Inmarsat provides the Developer Kit to qualified
[***ELEVATE***](https://www.inmarsat.com/en/solutions-services/enterprise/services/elevate.html)
