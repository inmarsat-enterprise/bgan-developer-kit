<img alt="Developer Kit" src="./docs/media/bgan-dev-kit.png" width="75%" height="auto">

The BGAN IoT Developer Kit comes with everything you need to start working with
Inmarsat's IP IoT messaging service ***BGAN***:
    
* A satellite modem, self-contained with antenna and GPS/GNSS in a weatherproof
enclosure
* Cables to connect to AC or 12VC DC power, including an international power
adapter, cable extenders and a magnetic roof-mount for the satellite modem
if applicable
* A single-board computer (SBC) with interface to the satellite modem, which
provides:
    * WiFi link between a laptop, tablet or smartphone and the satellite modem
    * A Graphical User Interface to the satellite modem and SBC
    * A simple demo "Edge" application that generates location and modem
    telemetry data and allows sending/receiving text messages
